# JavaScript-TypeScript-Exploration

Welcome to the JavaScript-TypeScript-Exploration repository! This repository is dedicated to providing an in-depth learning experience of JavaScript, focusing on how it works and its application in real-world scenarios. While the examples and code are primarily written in TypeScript, it's important to note that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, and learning TypeScript will enhance your understanding of JavaScript concepts.

**Note: This repository also serves as my personal learning journal, documenting my journey as I explore the intricacies of JavaScript and TypeScript.**

Feel free to adjust the wording or placement of the line to best fit your intentions and preferences.

# Introduction
JavaScript is a versatile programming language that powers the web, enabling dynamic and interactive web applications. Understanding JavaScript in-depth is crucial for developers aiming to build robust and efficient applications, regardless of whether they use JavaScript directly or TypeScript, which extends JavaScript with additional features.

This repository aims to guide you through an extensive exploration of JavaScript concepts (and also for my future reference), accompanied by TypeScript code examples. By leveraging TypeScript, you'll not only gain a solid understanding of JavaScript but also benefit from additional type-checking capabilities and modern language features.

# Directory Structure
The repository's directory structure is designed to facilitate comprehensive learning and easy navigation. Here's an overview of the main directories:

`topics/` : This directory contains subdirectories focused on various JavaScript concepts and areas of exploration. Each subdirectory provides detailed explanations, code examples in TypeScript, and relevant resources.

(TODO: Fix this Directory Structure)

# Getting Started
To make the most of this repository and deepen your understanding of JavaScript, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
  `git clone https://github.com/HeriYantodotDev/JavaScript-TypeScript-Exploration.git`
- Explore the directories within the topics/ folder to find specific JavaScript concepts you want to learn. Each subdirectory contains a README.md file that introduces the topic and provides code examples written in TypeScript.
- Read the README.md file in each directory to gain insights into the JavaScript concept, understand its underlying principles, and study the accompanying TypeScript code examples.
- To run the TypeScript code examples, you can follow these steps:
  - Install TypeScript globally on your machine using the command: `npm install -g typescript`. 
  - Install `ts-node` using this command : `npm install -g ts-node`
  - Navigate to the directory containing the TypeScript file you want to run.
  - Run the following command to execute TypeScript directly : `ts-node okay.ts`
- Feel free to modify the code examples, experiment with different approaches, and explore additional resources to deepen your understanding of JavaScript and TypeScript concepts.
