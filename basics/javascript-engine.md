# JavaScript Engine

You may have heard of the V8 engine, which is created by Google. It's one example of a JavaScript engine. Think of it as a powerful brain for JavaScript that Google built. The V8 engine understands and executes JavaScript code super fast, allowing websites and applications to run smoothly. 

A JavaScript engine is like a super-smart interpreter that understands and runs JavaScript code. It's like a language translator for computers. When you write JavaScript instructions, the engine reads and understands them. It tells your machine what to do step by step, like solving math problems, remembering important information, and making things happen on the screen.
